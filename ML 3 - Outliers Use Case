Instructions :  Implement the requirements in Python and submit both the HTML and IPYNB files. Use Markdown to incorporate the questions below, and provide a PDF file containing answers to some of the questions.

1. Define the problem you are trying to solve using machine learning . 
2. Identify the data sources and data collection methodologies
2. Determine what type of data is needed (structured or unstructured).
3. Define the features (variables) relevant to the problem.
4. Explain why this data is critical for solving the problem.
5. Assess the data quality and relevance  by verifying whether the dataset is complete, unbiased and represented.
6. Identify the missing values and inconsistencies
7. Analyze the data distribution
8. Illustrate Data Status with appropriate visualization
9. Explain the presence of outliers by detecting outliers, reason for outliers and handling outliers.
10. Given a dataset with multiple features, how would you determine which features are most relevant for your machine learning model? Describe at least two feature selection techniques and their advantages.
11. You detected several extreme values in your dataset using the IQR method and Z-score analysis. How would you decide whether to remove, transform, or retain these outliers? Provide examples of when each approach is appropriate.
12. You created a boxplot for a dataset and observed that one feature has a long right whisker, indicating a positive skew. What does this tell you about the data, and how would you address this issue before training your machine learning model?
