Instruction :

1. Collect the datasets
2. Detect outliers using Statistical methods (z-score, interquartile etc.) and visualize it
3. Detect outlier using machine learning methods (isolation methods, density-based outlier detection, PCA Based, XGboost) and visualize it.
4. Compare outlier counts from each method (statistical and machine learning methods)
5.  Handle outliers and Compare Performance (removing, winsorization and log transformation)
6. Evaluate the impact of handling outliers by training a machine learning model (e.g. (SVM, Regression, Random Forest etc.) before and after outlier handling
7. Interpret the result by summarizing all findings and specifically answer the following questions>
7.1 How do different outlier detection techniques impact the identification of anomalies in the datasets?
7.2 How does the presence of outliers affect the performance of different machine learning models?
7.3 Why does a certain models show the most improved before and after removing outliers compared to other models?
7.4 What are the potential drawbacks of removing outliers from a datasets?
7.5  If you were working with a real-word datasets, what factors would you consider before deciding to remove outliers?
